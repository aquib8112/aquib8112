### Hi, I am Aquib 
Hi, I'm Aquib Ahmad.
I work at the intersection of AI engineering and product development—building practical tools powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tabular machine learning, and modern LLM infrastructure.
Lately, I’ve been focused on building real-world products like Chrome extensions and lightweight assistants. I enjoy fast iterations, clean architecture, and solving meaningful problems.
If you're interested in building AI products or want to collaborate on one of mine, feel free to reach out. I'm always open to working with motivated people.
Check out some of my recent work below.
